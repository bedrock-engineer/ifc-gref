 *
 * Two parameter tracks intentionally:
 *
 * - `editableParameters` — what the user is currently editing (or seeded
 *   from IfcSite / file). Survives projection failure, so the editing
 *   surface (AnchorCard / RotationCard) keeps showing the typed value
 *   and its inline validator gets to run. Null only when there's nothing
 *   to edit yet (no file, no CRS, no seed).
 *
 * - `effectiveParameters` — same value, gated by a project-through-proj4
 *   check (`helmertProjectsInsideCrs`). Drives everything that would
 *   crash or render NaN on bad input: map overlays, 3D layer, camera
 *   framing, IFC write, sidecar export, anchor pick. Null whenever the
 *   current Helmert would land outside the active CRS's domain.
 *
 * The two diverge exactly when the user has typed an out-of-area value;
 * downstream consumers see the gated null while the editing UI keeps
 * showing what the user typed (and surfaces an inline validation
 * error). Editing cards consume `editableParameters`; everything else
